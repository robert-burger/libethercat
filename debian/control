Description: An embeddable realtime EtherCAT-master library.
  This library provides all functionality to communicate with EtherCAT slaves attached to a Network interface.
    support for a queue with mailbox init command for every slave
    distributed clock support
    mailbox support CoE, SoE, FoE,
    scan EtherCAT bus in INIT-to-INIT state transition, thus switching to INIT in every case will do a bus re-scan.
    switching to PREOP state will enable full mailbox support if it is supported by the corresponding EtherCAT slave.
    a PREOP-to-SAFEOP prepares all slaves configured in a process data group
        sending init command
        calculate cyclic process data sizes
        create sync manager configuration
        create fmmu configuration
        configure slave's for distributed clocks
        cyclically provide meassurement of process data
    a SAFEOP-to-OP transition additionally sends command to the attached slaves in every group cycle.
    efficient frame scheduling: EtherCAT datagrams are only queued in state SAFEOP and OP. They will be put in one ore many Ethernet frames and sent all cyclically with one call to hw_tx()
