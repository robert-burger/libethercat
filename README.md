# libethercat 

EtherCAT-master library  

This library provides all functionality to communicate with EtherCAT slaves attached to a Network interface. 

* support for a queue with mailbox init command for every slave
* distributed clock support
* mailbox support CoE, SoE, FoE, 

* scan EtherCAT bus in INIT-to-INIT state transition, thus switching to INIT in every case will do a bus re-scan.
* switching to PREOP state will enable full mailbox support if it is supported by the corresponding EtherCAT slave.
* a PREOP-to-SAFEOP prepares all slaves configured in a process data group
    * sending init command
    * calculate cyclic process data sizes
    * create sync manager configuration
    * create fmmu configuration
    * configure slave's for distributed clocks
    * cyclically provide meassurement of process data
* a SAFEOP-to-OP transition additionally sends command to the attached slaves in every group cycle.
* efficient frame scheduling: EtherCAT datagrams are only queued in state SAFEOP and OP. They will be put in one ore many Ethernet frames and sent all cyclically with one call to hw_tx()

# Network device access

- **raw socket** » The most common way sending ethernet frames in Linux is opening a raw network socket (`SOCK_RAW`). Therefor the program must either be run as root or with the capability flag `CAP_NET_RAW`. 
- **raw_socket_mmaped** » Like above but don't use read/write to provide frame buffers to kernel and use mmaped buffers directly from kernel.
- **file** » Most performant/determinstic interface to send/receive frames with network hardware. Requires hacked linux network driver. Can also be used without interrupts to avoid context switches. For how to compile and use such a driver head over to [drivers readme](linux/README.md).
- **pikeos** » Special pikeos hardware access.

## Usage 

See INTRODUCTION.md or gh-pages for reference.

## Build from source

`libethercat` uses autotools as build system. 

### Prerequisites

Ensure that `libosal` is installed in your system. You can get `libosal` from here https://github.com/robert-burger/libosal.git . To build `libethercat` from source execute something like:

```
git clone https://github.com/robert-burger/libethercat.git
cd libethercat
autoreconf -is
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

This will build and install a static as well as a dynamic library. For use in other project you can use the generated pkg-config file to retreave cflags and linker flags.

### CMake

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
# Please change the path to the install dir. If you chose a global install you can omit the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH option
cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<installdir of libosal>
cmake --build . 
```

## Tools

libethercat also provides some small helper programs for the EtherCAT bus.

### eepromtool

With eepromtool you can read and write EtherCAT slave's eeprom. 

#### read eeprom

To do a read operation simply run:

    eepromtool -i eth1 -s 0 -r -f eeprom.bin

If no filename if specified, eepromtool will print the contents to stdout, which you can pipe to hexdump for example.

    eepromtool -i eth1 -s 0 -r | hexdump -v -C | less -S

#### write

To do a write operation simply run:

    eepromtool -i eth1 -s 0 -w -f eeprom.bin

If no filename if specified, eepromtool will read from stdin.

    cat eeprom.bin | eepromtool -i eth1 -s 0 -w

#### example_with_dc

This is a more complex example on how to use libethercat in realtime/control systems. 

It tries to do the following:

* Scan the EtherCAT network.
* Try to do a default configuration of the found slaves
* Configures distributed clocks of all slaves (if supported)
* Create a periodic realtime task which does cyclic data (process data) exchange.
* Do some jitter logging.
